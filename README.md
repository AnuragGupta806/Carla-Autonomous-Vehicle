## Phase 1:Object Detection
First part of our project involved detecting real world objects in carla simulated environment. For this, we took help of a well known detection model called YOLO4(You Only Look once) because of its great tradeoff between Speed and Accuracy.

- YOLO4 weights file can be downloaded from this [Link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights) and placed in the models folder

- Youtube video of its Live Demo can be found at this [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vct5sLkOILU&t=56s)
